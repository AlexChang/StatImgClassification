## Structure description

* Folder **./data/** stores training data and test data
* Folder **./graph/** stores the output images (currently, only pca.py generate images)
* Folder **./model/** stores the models we use in this project
* Folder **./parameter/** stores the hyperparameters we use in a specific model in json format (automatically generated by cv.py)
* Folder **./result/** stores the predict results
* Folder **./savedModel/** stores the trained model in joblib format (a binary form, automatically generated by cv.py)
* Folder **./score/** stores the cross-validation result in txt format (automatically generated by cv.py)
* File **augData.py** augments the training dataset using the prediction results of the following three classifiers ridge classification, logistic regression, and linear SVM
* File **cv.py** trains the model and evaluates the model performance using K-fold cross-validation
* File **hyperParameter.py** defines a class for storing hyperparameters
* File **pca.py** performs PCA and FA dimension selection
* File **readme.md** is this file:)
* File **utils.py** defines general functions such as reading and writing files in the project

## Requirements

* Python 3
* numpy
* sklearn
* joblib

## Usage

Make sure your file structure is as shown above, and put *train.csv* and *test.csv* in the folder **./data/** (these two files are not included in the uploaded package), just run 
```
python cv.py
```
Or you can pass some arguments to the program to make it use a different method
```
python cv.py --mode linSvm --pre minmax
```
See the instructions in the code for details.
